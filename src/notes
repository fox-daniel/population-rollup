There are 74003 rows; row 0 is column names; 74002 rows of census data

CREATE VIRTUALENV WITH JUST PYTHON3.7.3

Write new csv with only the necessary columns?

CSI = 3 if outside of CBSA

CBSA title has "," so enclose title in double quotes

How will my solution scale? 
	Test on a larger data set, generate it so it can be used for tests

Tests: separate folder for each test
	-to run test, move input & output csv's to top-level input and output directories and run code
	-use pandas to generate input and output files for tests
	-Unit
	-End-to-end
	-move all reused functions to a module in src
	-test rounding

Run.sh
	use python3.7 command in 

For this challenge, we want to know for each Core Based Statistical Area, the

total number of census tracts,
total population in 2000,
total population in 2010 and
average population percent change for census tracts in this Core Based Statistical Area

1. select relevant columns
2. groupby CBSA -- Must deal with tracts not in CBSA 
	count number of census tracts
	sum pop from 2000
	sum pop from 2010
	mean PCH

For every line that exists in the output file, the following fields should be written in this order:

Core Based Statstical Area Code (i.e., CBSA09)
Core Based Statistical Area Code Title (i.e., CBSA_T)
total number of census tracts
total population in the CBSA in 2000
total population in the CBSA in 2010
average population percent change for census tracts in this CBSA. Round to two decimal places using standard rounding conventions (i.e., Any percentage between 0.005% and 0.010%, inclusive, should round to 0.01% and anything less than 0.005% should round to 0.00%)
