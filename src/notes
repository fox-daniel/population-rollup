Write new csv with only the necessary columns?

CSI = 3 if outside of CBSA


For this challenge, we want to know for each Core Based Statistical Area, the

total number of census tracts,
total population in 2000,
total population in 2010 and
average population percent change for census tracts in this Core Based Statistical Area

1. select relevant columns
2. count CBSA
3. count census tracts not in a CBSA
3. groupby CBSA and: 
	count number of census tracts
	sum pop from 2000
	sum pop from 2000
	mean PCH

For every line that exists in the output file, the following fields should be written in this order:

Core Based Statstical Area Code (i.e., CBSA09)
Core Based Statistical Area Code Title (i.e., CBSA_T)
total number of census tracts
total population in the CBSA in 2000
total population in the CBSA in 2010
average population percent change for census tracts in this CBSA. Round to two decimal places using standard rounding conventions (i.e., Any percentage between 0.005% and 0.010%, inclusive, should round to 0.01% and anything less than 0.005% should round to 0.00%)
